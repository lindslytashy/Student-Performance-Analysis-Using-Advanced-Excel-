# Student Performance Dashboard – Excel-Based Data Visualization Project

This project is part of my learning journey in data visualization, developed after completing the PwC "Data Visualization with Advanced Excel" course on Coursera. As someone actively building skills in data analytics, I created this project to practice working with structured data, explore patterns in student performance  and design a functional and interactive Excel dashboard.

The goal of this project was to apply the concepts learned in the course to a real dataset and build something that communicates insights clearly to users — similar to how a business might present performance metrics in a dashboard.

## Project Purpose

The dataset represents academic performance among students, alongside demographic and program-related variables. As part of my learning, I focused on the following questions:

- Does test preparation improve student performance?
- Are there performance differences between male and female students?
- How do socioeconomic indicators like lunch status relate to scores?
- Can Excel tools like Goal Seek help model real-life academic scenarios?

This project is the result of exploring those questions through a visual, interactive, and analytical lens using Excel.

## Skills and Tools Practiced

This project gave me a chance to strengthen my skills with the following Excel features:

- **PivotTables** – Used to summarize data by category (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, test prep and others).
- **PivotCharts** – Used to turn those summaries into visual insights.
- **Slicers** – Added to allow users to interactively filter the dashboard.
- **Goal Seek** – Used to calculate required scores to achieve a target average.
- **Scenario Manager** – Applied to simulate different academic outcomes based on changing inputs.
- **Power Query (Get & Transform)** – Used for basic data preparation and loading.

These tools helped me build a more dynamic, insightful analysis and better understand how dashboards can support decisions.

## Key Takeaways

- Students who completed test prep scored noticeably higher across all subjects.
- There are observable score trends based on gender and lunch type.
- Interactive dashboards can make analysis more accessible to non-technical users.
- Even without complex tools like Power BI or Tableau, Excel is powerful for analysis and storytelling.
